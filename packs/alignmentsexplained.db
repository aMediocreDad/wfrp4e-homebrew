Dissonance, uncertainty and discord are reflected by the Chaos side of your Alignment.</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h2>DETERMINE YOUR ALIGNMENT</h2>\n<p>Alignment is generally treated as a pairing of two distinct, but similar, personality traits. Determine your Alignment by rolling D100, consulting the table below. Record it on the first page of your Character sheet. For instance, if Adaptation is your Order Alignment, Mayhem will be your Chaos Alignment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>ROLE-PLAYING ALIGNMENT</h2>\n<p>Consider this axiom: an Order Alignment is not intended for you to steer towards, nor the Chaos Alignment to steer away from, to achieve some kind of nebulous success or neutrality. You should think of longer-term development arcs where your strengths either overcome your failings or tragically do not. Consider the best books, movies or video games you have experienced; you&rsquo;ll realize that this is how memorable tales are crafted and told.</p>\n<p>Alignments make no distinctions between what is right or wrong; that is left for the players and the GM to decide. To what ends these Order and Chaos Alignments are deployed makes no moral supposition &ndash; for example, Heroism can easily be called upon in pursuit of a darker, nefarious purpose. Most importantly, don&rsquo;t consider the Order and Chaos Alignment comparable to a strict &lsquo;good&rsquo; or &lsquo;evil&rsquo; paradigm, no matter how you choose to act upon them.</p>\n<h2>CALLING OUT ALIGNMENT</h2>\n<p>When confronted with tense situations where you&rsquo;re uncertain how your Character would act, look to their Alignments. They provide a simple guide for how your Character perceives themselves and the world around them. However, if you&rsquo;re stumped, call out your Alignment to the GM for inspiration. They can help guide your choices by providing a few additional options and provide incentives to help you find a desirable&nbsp; outcome. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to explain motives, out-of-Character at the game table, before your Character acts towards their Order Alignment! This is a helpful tool that can aid new role-players, particularly as they begin to understand what it means to call upon the axiom of Alignment.</p>\n<p>Remember &ndash; your Character&rsquo;s Alignments are merely a guide. They do not strictly bind you to a specific outcome or behavior, but should help to define and reflect your Character&rsquo;s persona over the course of a campaign.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>FIFTY SHADES OF MORALITY</h2>\n<p>While your Order and Chaos Alignment are intended as guidelines towards the values that your Character holds dearest, you are not a puppet held up by only two strings. The sort of one switch, knee jerk reaction to every possible scenario doesn&rsquo;t realistically reflect how a fully fleshed individual would, or should, react. If you treat it as a simple gimmick, expect it to lose significance at the game table. This applies both positively and negatively: if you consistently try to implausibly navigate your social interactions to take advantage of your Order Alignment, despite how ludicrous the situation, expect the GM to disallow (or even suspend for a length of time) any benefit. By the same token, if you use your Chaos Alignment simply as a tool to harass or bicker with others, there are swifter and easier punishments that can come to bear: your growing reputation as a madman, a child or a fool.</p>\n<p>That makes you an easy target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>CHANGING ALIGNMENT</h2>\n<p>Your Alignment may change over the course of a campaign. These sorts of changes are always the result of major events that transpire as you play your Character. Events that lead to such a shift in personality should be long in the making, rare or climactic enough to justify the change. Your Alignment may change due to a traumatic experience where your Character is faced with the death of a loved one or friend, a particularly glorifying or unvirtuous choice you made, a frightening conclusion to a long story arc, the effect of madness or any other host of instances you and the GM feel appropriate.</p>\n<p>While we provide no specific guidelines for how and when you should change your Alignment, it is best to work with the GM to make these decisions together as a result of completing larger story arcs or distinct changes in personality.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>TAPPING INTO ALIGNMENT</h2>\n<p>During every game session, you should strive to use one or both of your Alignments in interesting ways during social interactions with other Characters. This could be as simple as leaning on your Order Alignment during role-play, potentially influencing the game session in a unique way through the narrative or by making story-altering choices that lead to interesting (and potentially dire) outcomes. These situations should be unique and creative, drawing from the story how the narrative impacts your Character and how it plays towards their personality. The opportunities are endless! Throughout the story, the GM will present several instances during the game session where your Character should look to their Alignment to influence the narrative.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Characters secretly investigate a dockyard murder at the behest of a criminal organization. As a part of this investigation, the GM plans to have the Characters encounter a pair of city guards who are attempting to cover up the murder. As the game session continues, Danziger Eckhardt comes face-to- face with the guards. Danziger could lean on his Ferocity Alignment at this moment, role-playing his dogged pursuit for truth by warding away the city guards with the threat of violence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t create a situation where you simply justify one of your Character&rsquo;s decisions as playing to their Alignment. Actions speak louder than words. You should distinctly know &ndash; and should even call out during the game session &ndash; when your Character&rsquo;s Alignment flares, directly influencing the role-play and narrative!</p>",}
